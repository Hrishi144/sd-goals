            <h2 class="goal-number">Goal 1</h2>
            <h2>End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere</h2>
            <p>Poverty affects billions of people globally and is one of the most urgent challenges of our time. It goes beyond 
               the lack of income and resources for a sustainable livelihood, affecting access to basic services, social protections, 
               and participation in decision-making processes. Eradicating poverty is not just about providing material resources, 
               but also about enabling individuals and communities to overcome systemic barriers to opportunity. Reducing poverty 
               requires coordinated global actions, such as improving access to education, healthcare, and social protections while 
               promoting policies that foster job creation, income equity, and economic growth that benefits everyone.</p>

            <h2 class="goal-number">Goal 2</h2>
            <h2>End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Hunger affects more than 800 million people worldwide, with many suffering from malnutrition that leads to stunted 
               growth and weakened immune systems. Food insecurity can be caused by conflict, natural disasters, and economic shocks, 
               disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations, including women and children. Achieving this goal requires 
               ensuring that people have access to enough nutritious food year-round. This involves promoting sustainable agriculture, 
               investing in resilient food production systems, supporting smallholder farmers, and improving market access to make sure 
               food is distributed fairly and efficiently, even in times of crisis.</p>

            <h2>Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-Being for All</h2>
            <p>Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being is crucial for building prosperous societies. Despite progress, millions 
               of people still die each year from preventable diseases, lack of access to essential healthcare services, or complications 
               related to pregnancy and childbirth. This goal seeks to address these issues by improving maternal and child health, 
               reducing the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and ensuring that all people have access to 
               affordable and quality healthcare. Mental health also plays a key role in achieving this goal, as it impacts individuals’ 
               ability to live productive lives. Addressing the root causes of health disparities, from access to clean water to 
               universal healthcare coverage, is essential to achieving this goal.</p>

            <h2>Ensure Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education</h2>
            <p>Education is a powerful tool for reducing inequality and ensuring sustainable development. Goal 4 focuses on providing 
               inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all, starting from early childhood education through to higher education. 
               However, disparities in access to education still exist, with many children, especially girls, in rural areas or conflict 
               zones being denied the opportunity to learn. Ensuring access to quality education also means improving infrastructure, 
               ensuring teachers are well-trained, and integrating technology to provide lifelong learning opportunities for all. 
               Additionally, education should promote global citizenship, sustainable development, gender equality, and human rights, 
               equipping future generations to solve the challenges the world faces today.</p>

            <h2 class="goal-number">Goal 5</h2>
            <h2>Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls</h2>
            <p>Gender equality is a fundamental human right and key to achieving a fairer, more peaceful world. Women and girls face 
               systemic barriers, such as violence, discrimination, and lack of access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities. 
               Achieving gender equality involves ensuring equal participation and leadership roles for women in all sectors of society, 
               eliminating gender-based violence, ensuring access to reproductive health services, and addressing the unpaid care burden 
               disproportionately shouldered by women. By promoting women’s empowerment and protecting the rights of girls, societies 
               can become more inclusive, economically prosperous, and sustainable.</p>

            <h2 class="goal-number">Goal 6</h2>
            <h2>Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All</h2>
            <p>Water is essential for survival, and access to clean water and sanitation is a human right. Yet, billions of people 
               still lack safe drinking water, and many more live without proper sanitation facilities. Goal 6 focuses on ensuring 
               that all people have access to safe and affordable drinking water, improving water quality by reducing pollution, 
               and managing water resources sustainably to prevent scarcity. This goal also emphasizes the need to protect and restore 
               water-related ecosystems such as rivers and lakes, as well as promoting community involvement in water management. 
               Sustainable water management is critical for maintaining health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.</p>
